How to create Secrets.cs

You'd need to create an API Key from flickr - using this guide: https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/
That will give you the raw/unencrypted values for ConsumerKey and ConsumerSecret - these cannot be applied into Secret.cs yet (we need to encrypt them using a SharedSecret).
The SharedSecret is just a random string (with alphanumeric characters) and use that as the CryptKey within this unit test to generate the encrypted values for your flickr API key (ConsumerKey and ConsumerSecret) and update those into Secret.cs which should look like this:

namespace FloydPink.Flickr.Downloadr.Bootstrap
{
    public static class Secrets
    {
        // a random secret string
        public const string SharedSecret = "";

        // your API key from flickr, encrypted using the "shared" secret above
        public const string ConsumerKey = "";

        // your API secret from flickr, encrypted using the "shared" secret above
        public const string ConsumerSecret = "";
    }
}

One all the values have been determined, create Secrects.cs file and drop it to root of "source" folder. Now you can compile the code.

Please note, the Secrets.cs has been ignored by Git. Don't change it since you don't want others to be able to read your secrets.
